## Development Note

### Cairo smart Contract

https://github.com/Block-Developers/NFT_Hunters/blob/master/games/contracts/src/nftcraft.cairo

- This has object NFT with location data
- User can interact on-chain world with NFTs

### ProtoStar and Warp integration

https://github.com/Block-Developers/NFT_Hunters/tree/master/games/contracts/warplib

- It was difficult to use warp with protostar at first, but we did it
- This enables complicated smart contract development
